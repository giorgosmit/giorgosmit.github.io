# About me



I currently as an IT support specialist at Hyetos engineering consulting company. I have also worked on data science machine learning research projects , using mainly neural networks in the context of hydraulic engineering.

I've got a Master's degree in [Political Science and Sociology](http://en.pspa.uoa.gr/) from the University of Athens. I am now working on my second Master's, this time in [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.phs.uoa.gr/) in the History and Philosophy of Science Department of the University of Athens. 

I am proficient at statistical analysis of social and behavioral data, using mainly R and Python. I am currently aiming to enrich my skills at social modeling using mainly Python, and intend to pursue a PhD in the near future, in the field of Cognitive Science.
