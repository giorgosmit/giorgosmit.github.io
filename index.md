Hello and thank you for visiting my page. My name is George Mitkidis, and I am a social scientist by training (Masters of Political Science and Sociology from Athens University), but currently work in IT. I also pursue a second master's, this time in Cognitive Science (again, Athens University), and have recently started semi-seriously dabbling with programming, both at work and at home. My current pursuits are machine learning as well as social and cognitive modeling as parts of my research interests in my current Master's (I have done a couple of conference presentations, which I will upload here soon!).
